Macaroons for Rust
==================
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/cryptosphere/rust-macaroons.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/cryptosphere/rust-macaroons)

Macaroons Are Better Than Cookies!

Macaroons are a bearer credential format built around "caveats", i.e. conditions
that must hold for a particular credential to be authorized. Using neat crypto
tricks, anyone holding a Macaroon can add more caveats to a Macaroon, but once
caveats are added they cannot be removed.

### Is it any good?

[Yes.](http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3067434)

### Is it "Production Readyâ„¢"?

![DANGER: EXPERIMENTAL](https://raw.github.com/cryptosphere/cryptosphere/master/images/experimental.png)

No. This library only implements part of the Macaroons token format, and the API
is changing rapidly.

The following features have been implemented:

* Creating Macaroons
* First-party caveats
* Serializing to base64url-encoded binary format

The following features need to be implemented for this library to be useful:

* Deserializing and verifying Macaroons
* Third-party caveats

## Usage

Coming soon!
